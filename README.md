# networksimulation

Purpose of this repository is to further research on networks. The original author of this rep is "https://github.com/Braudt". The same license as the original is added to the rep. 

Any changes made to the original here are only for research experimentation. The steps below show minor changes made to the original codebase.

#Setup 
(virtual_environment is recommended)
- install python==3.7.3 
- install libraries using "requirements.txt" file
- run the main.py file 

The "main.py" executes all the files which run experiments(generate PDF and saves results of output by the same name of the .py files). All results in output logs will be appended in their respective .txt files. Although new PDF will be generated each time the "main.py" is executed.
